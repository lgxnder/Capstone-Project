Challenges 
The Phase 1 prototype was developed and put up without any significant difficulties. 
Standard tooling and specified dependencies were used to correctly configure the frontend and backend environments.

Finding the best React configuration for the frontend presented a small issue. 
We decided on Vite with React utilizing a JavaScript setup after weighing our options.  
Compared to other React configurations, this method was selected because of its quicker development server starting, 
easier configuration, and lightweight setup.  
Additionally, Vite allows environment-based configuration and combines well with contemporary tooling, 
making it appropriate for Phase 1 rapid prototyping.
