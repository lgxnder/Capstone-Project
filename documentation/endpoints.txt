To develop a new endpoint with our current architecture,
first decide the type of routing - front-end or back-end.

For front-end routing, we have the endpoint 'home/',
which currently serves a simple HTML template.
Additionally, the root or '/' endpoint redirects to 'home/'.
Front-end routes are located in ./frontend/urls.py .

For back-end routing, we have a controller for the API,
which is simply 'api/'. There is currently an endpoint at 'api/test/',
which serves a simple HTML page.
Back-end routes are located in ./backend/urls.py .

Specific controller configurations, as well as redirections
are located in ./config/urls.py .
